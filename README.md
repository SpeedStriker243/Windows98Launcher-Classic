# Windows 98 Launcher (classic)
The old version of [Windows 98 Launcher](https://github.com/SpeedStriker243/Windows98Launcher/) (I fricked up and did a `git push -f origin master`, so the old data is gone from the original repo)

Thanks to [dports](https://github.com/dports)/[dpteam](https://github.com/dpteam) for forking the original repo before the destructive frick-up!
